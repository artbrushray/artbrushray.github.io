Belisarius Cawl and C’Tan Zarhulash scene Hey everybody! In this artwork I want to return to the “Great Work” book and to show one of the most fascinating to my opinion scenes - the talk between Belisarius Cawl and the C’tan Zarhulash. There was several reasons for me to paint it: this scene thought, important from the lore perspective has never been illustrated. Then another important reason, there is no picture of Zarhulas. So this image of him is my free fan interpretation. Cawl at least has the miniature and straight refs to AdMech overall design. But C’tan themself is a vast field for imagination. For this particular art I was inspired by ancient Egyptian culture and Art Deco style. I hope you like the illustration, if so you may support me on the Artstation with thumb up. There you can also find hi-res for of this art for a poster: https://www.artstation.com/brushray

Lord Krios the Siegebreaker Had a chance recently to paint some more chaos terminators. This time is a terminator chaos lord of a custom warband. He’s a former Iron Warrior that joined a Word Bearers warband called the Doomed. The image was painted from miniature reference: https://www.instagram.com/p/CwSXAkUtRiV/
And more description taken from there: Poliorkitikos Krios, a former Iron Warrior who joined the ranks of The Doomed warband, has rapidly risen through the command structure when the warband found its combat doctrine lacking in battles of attrition. In times of need Krios is elevated to the rank of Lord Commander but outside campaigns he prefers to go by his Council title “Lord of Siege”. His equipment includes: indomitus-pattern terminator armor salvaged from a slain Imperial Fist captain standard combi-melta with self-calibrating combat optics feeding directly into a split ocular nerve Bane of Bulwarks, a sonic thunderhammer crafted by 𝙙𝙖𝙩𝙖 𝙘𝙤𝙧𝙧𝙪𝙥𝙩𝙚𝙙. The impact of each hit is so severe Krios had to retrofit a powerfist to absorb the raw kinetic force able to rip an astartes arm open.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Hey everyone! Today is a special artwork on Warhammer40k here. We keep expanding lore of the Iron Butchers warband: Make sure to check their instagram: https://www.instagram.com/enter.the.butcher/
If you may remember I painted a star ship for this warband, the Iron Maw, on which they crusade the Galaxy: https://www.artstation.com/artwork/g00LWe This artwork shows a pretty special part of this ship called The Daemonastrolabium. Basically it’s a huge compass which navigates the warp.
A shared effort by the Iron Butchers Warpsmith and Dark Mechanicum Hereteks, the Daemonastrolabium is a huge, daemonic device located in the highest spire of the observatory dome of the Iron Maw. The device, commonly known as daemon-compass, is a creation whose goal was to allow the Iron Butchers to perform warp-travel without the need of a Navigator, since the latter are rare individuals, often prone to madness or death, due to the nature of the Chaos, or unwilling to help traitor Warbands.

A tomb has awakened releasing it’s dormant horrors… Necrons is a special art subject for me. I did my first tries on them about 3-4 years. And what is special ever since my artistic vision of them has been changing several times. Of course the first attempts were pretty clumsy and some next art then became more mature. Nevertheless Necrons though humanoid yet distinctly different from humans at their primal form before the transfer. And the main challenge I think is to grasp this difference and be able to express it along with mean consequences of the transfer. This challenging aspect and a strong undead vibe keep inspiring me.

    <p>I use dry media a lot. Charcoal, pencil, pastel,sepia in all variations. I learned to control them and comparing to paints they seemed more friendly and simple to me. I don’t need to think about drying layers, mixing colours, distorting paper, fading tones etc. The result with dry media strict and straight, mostly pure form reflected in monotone. One the other hand my aspiration always has been oil painting. When water colours and gouache I simply didn’t liked, oils I was afraid of! Dry media was a sort of preparation to use oils and I considered to use them later when my academic skill will be more solid. Adding to this all complications with oil painting techniques such as mediums, priming, colour mixing etc., I kept postponing my meeting with oils and worked with dry media only. Last winter was difficult and full of anxious thoughts. It caused me a sort of burn out and depression. I kept clinging to working and art for nothing much of other options left to keep me afloat. Spring came and brought some relief and along with this a trivial thought that waiting for a perfect moment is a waist of time and futile expectation. I think I was exalting and idealising oil paints too much. May be for some time I was in need of such ideal of a noble stage of the art journey which requires a lot of preparations, as another motivation kind. After these stressing times I had thought that idealising oils is childish, I don’t need any particular cause or moment or level to step in. I started from videos at least to sort out technical aspects and it was not too difficult. It’s difficult for a perfect results on some heavy art work. But to start bare minimum is like a bunch of brushes, dark warm and dark cold paints plus white (3 tubes in total if to work in monochrome) and a medium to dilute the paint oil or varnish. As a canvas can work anything thick enough and primed in acrylic paint. Actually, I skipped the last point with priming and just used usual office paper for printer with water proof lining to prevent oil from soaking thru paper and spreading around. You can see the result.

    <p>Hey everyone! Fresh art for Iron Butchers https://www.instagram.com/enter.the.butcher/ This time it’s a ship the warband uses to crusade the galaxy. Plus here is a bit of story content from Iron Butchers public. Please, enjoy.
Captain Heuldrasia was carried on the Command Bridge by her personal servitor. She was cradled in its arms like a baby in the mother’s chest. The servitor laid the Captain’s mangled body in the Command Throne, and rapidly connected to the ship’s systems, allowing her mind to fuse, once more, with the ship’s Machine Spirit. Heuldrasia consciousness split in two, one part still aware of her physical surrounding, has communication with the ship’s officers couldn’t be interrupted, while the other sank in the vessel’s core where she met the Machine Spirit again. The Iron Maw essence was a being born to fire and blood, violence and hate, build 10 Millenia before in the forges of Sarum to serve the XIIth Legion, and as the XIIth Legion she slaughtered out of enjoyment, not only duty. But the beast as long ago accepted the guiding hand of Heuldrasia nonetheless, and now welcomed the presence of the Captain, for each was of little worth without the other.
