&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lord Krios the Siegebreaker&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://artbrushray.github.io/img/2024/Lord-Krios-by-brushray-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Lord Krios the Siegebreaker, fan art by Dmitry Brushray&#34;  /&gt;

Had a chance recently to paint some more chaos terminators.
This time is a terminator chaos lord of a custom warband.
He&amp;rsquo;s a former Iron Warrior that joined a Word Bearers warband called the Doomed. The image was painted from miniature reference: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/p/CwSXAkUtRiV/&#34;&gt;https://www.instagram.com/p/CwSXAkUtRiV/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And more description taken from there:
Poliorkitikos Krios, a former Iron Warrior who joined the ranks of The Doomed warband, has rapidly risen through the command structure when the warband found its combat doctrine lacking in battles of attrition.
In times of need Krios is elevated to the rank of Lord Commander but outside campaigns he prefers to go by his Council title &amp;ldquo;Lord of Siege&amp;rdquo;.
His equipment includes:
indomitus-pattern terminator armor salvaged from a slain Imperial Fist captain
standard combi-melta with self-calibrating combat optics feeding directly into a split ocular nerve
Bane of Bulwarks, a sonic thunderhammer crafted by 𝙙𝙖𝙩𝙖 𝙘𝙤𝙧𝙧𝙪𝙥𝙩𝙚𝙙. The impact of each hit is so severe Krios had to retrofit a powerfist to absorb the raw kinetic force able to rip an astartes arm open.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I keep painting chaos space marines. This guy has pretty unusual and bright colour scheme. He&amp;rsquo;s a chaos champion for a warband called the Reproached Hollows, He&amp;rsquo;s only known as &amp;ldquo;The Cyclopes&amp;rdquo;
Special thanks to Littlerevy and her miniature reference:

Roman warrior, short personal work, a painting study&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Daemonastrolabium of the Iron Maw</title>
      <link>https://artbrushray.github.io/posts/compass/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! Today is a special artwork on Warhammer40k here.
We keep expanding lore of the Iron Butchers warband:
Make sure to check their instagram: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/enter.the.butcher/&#34;&gt;https://www.instagram.com/enter.the.butcher/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you may remember I painted a star ship for this warband, the Iron Maw, on which they crusade the Galaxy: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.artstation.com/artwork/g00LWe&#34;&gt;https://www.artstation.com/artwork/g00LWe&lt;/a&gt;
This artwork shows a pretty special part of this ship called The Daemonastrolabium. Basically it&amp;rsquo;s a huge compass which navigates the warp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A shared effort by the Iron Butchers Warpsmith and Dark Mechanicum Hereteks, the Daemonastrolabium is a huge, daemonic device located in the highest spire of the observatory dome of the Iron Maw.
The device, commonly known as daemon-compass, is a creation whose goal was to allow the Iron Butchers to perform warp-travel without the need of a Navigator, since the latter are rare individuals, often prone to madness or death, due to the nature of the Chaos, or unwilling to help traitor Warbands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
