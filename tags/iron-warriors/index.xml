      <description>Hey everybody! This big bastard is Havok Smith Trelok Olethros the warlord of the Rust Corps Iron warrior warband. He replaced his arm with a chain cannon after losing in a fight with a Dark Angels Ravenwing captain. Most importantly he is completely and totally insane.
The Iron Warriors were the IV Legion of the twenty original Space Marine Legions. Their Primarch is Perturabo. They were one of the nine legions which betrayed the Emperor during the Horus Heresy, becoming Chaos Space Marines.</description>
