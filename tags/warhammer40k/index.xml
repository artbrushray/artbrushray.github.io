      <description>Hey everyone! This is another revamp of one of my work. The first art of this character was painted something about a year ago for the Iron Butchers warband: https://www.instagram.com/enter.the.butcher/ Here is the link to the post with the first version of Culsu: https://www.artstation.com/artwork/6bXRxV
Then there had been some progress in my vision and work process and we decided to make another art ot the character. So this post is the result: a character with helmet and without, plus some stages.</description>

      <description>Hey everyone! Check out my latest Warhammer fan art featuring a Nurgle Plague Marine. Corrupted by the foul blessings of Nurgle, this warrior is a testament to the power of the Lord of Decay. His rusted armor and diseased body spread twisted corruption that runs rampant in the 41st millennium.

      <description>Hey everyone! Fresh art for Iron Butchers https://www.instagram.com/enter.the.butcher/ This time it&amp;rsquo;s a ship the warband uses to crusade the galaxy. Plus here is a bit of story content from Iron Butchers public. Please, enjoy.
Captain Heuldrasia was carried on the Command Bridge by her personal servitor. She was cradled in its arms like a baby in the mother&amp;rsquo;s chest. The servitor laid the Captain&amp;rsquo;s mangled body in the Command Throne, and rapidly connected to the ship&amp;rsquo;s systems, allowing her mind to fuse, once more, with the ship&amp;rsquo;s Machine Spirit.</description>
