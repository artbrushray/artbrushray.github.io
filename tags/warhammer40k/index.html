AdMech vs some Heretics fan art Hey everyone! What I love about AdMech is that if a hand or leg a bit longer than it should be, it’s not a problem it’s an AdMech thing, you know. So yeh, scale might be a little bit off. However I wanted to paint a titan and a dunecrawler in a single battle scene. I hope you like it.

Belisarius Cawl and C’Tan Zarhulash scene Hey everybody! In this artwork I want to return to the “Great Work” book and to show one of the most fascinating to my opinion scenes - the talk between Belisarius Cawl and the C’tan Zarhulash. There was several reasons for me to paint it: this scene thought, important from the lore perspective has never been illustrated. Then another important reason, there is no picture of Zarhulas. So this image of him is my free fan interpretation. Cawl at least has the miniature and straight refs to AdMech overall design. But C’tan themself is a vast field for imagination. For this particular art I was inspired by ancient Egyptian culture and Art Deco style. I hope you like the illustration, if so you may support me on the Artstation with thumb up. There you can also find hi-res for of this art for a poster: https://www.artstation.com/brushray

Lord Krios the Siegebreaker Had a chance recently to paint some more chaos terminators. This time is a terminator chaos lord of a custom warband. He’s a former Iron Warrior that joined a Word Bearers warband called the Doomed. The image was painted from miniature reference: https://www.instagram.com/p/CwSXAkUtRiV/
And more description taken from there: Poliorkitikos Krios, a former Iron Warrior who joined the ranks of The Doomed warband, has rapidly risen through the command structure when the warband found its combat doctrine lacking in battles of attrition. In times of need Krios is elevated to the rank of Lord Commander but outside campaigns he prefers to go by his Council title “Lord of Siege”. His equipment includes: indomitus-pattern terminator armor salvaged from a slain Imperial Fist captain standard combi-melta with self-calibrating combat optics feeding directly into a split ocular nerve Bane of Bulwarks, a sonic thunderhammer crafted by 𝙙𝙖𝙩𝙖 𝙘𝙤𝙧𝙧𝙪𝙥𝙩𝙚𝙙. The impact of each hit is so severe Krios had to retrofit a powerfist to absorb the raw kinetic force able to rip an astartes arm open.

    <h2>the Emperor of mankind, fan art by Dmitry Brushray
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Hey everyone! Today I want to show you something really special. Ever since I started painting Warhammer fan art for many reasons I hadn’t been dared to think of approaching this potent figure, the Emperor of mankind. Besides required strong artistic skills one important reason was that I couldn’t see any good idea or a context to show him.
Then it has come pretty sudden, I guess it could be called an inspiration. First I realised his might could be shown only in comparison with some other objects or characters. I wanted to add astartes to his side but then I thought their size and anatomy indistinct too so instead I decided to add people. Small and puny as they are they became a great contrast to his scale, and it benefited for the further idea progress. At once a context stuck to the idea: he reveals his nature to these two poor souls. Librarians let them be, an old man and a young woman. The old man just can’t stand the Emperor side. The woman is a mild psyker so she is more sensitive. He begs her to turn her gaze down but she is ecstatic. She feels the Emperor’s might is unbearable and yet she can’t not to watch.

    <h2>Revamp of the ugliest fan art I ever painted, Necron Lord
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p> Recently I picked this idea of repainting my old art. It helps to spot some problems and estimate my current progress. After making few revamps I decided to pick I guess one of my biggest fails. Every time I see the initial art I had made, it reminds me horrors of the warp. I still don’t know how it happened, after all I wasn’t that bad at that time but with this fan art something went really wrong. Perhaps I was too much taken away with details or Necrons and the idea itself that I ditched out nearly everything that’s important to make a drawing looking good. This new version is not perfect either but it makes difference and sure thing a progress which adds motivation to keep pushing my progress. I want this work not to be a show off but rather an example of motivation for me and everyone who learn and struggle with results. So this concludes two things: patience and efforts one way or another will give results, the more you systematic the sooner and the better they will be; fails are important and not a big drama as against them the progress and results are visible. I hope you progress at what you are keen and enthusiastic!

    <p>Hey everyone! Today is a special artwork on Warhammer40k here. We keep expanding lore of the Iron Butchers warband: Make sure to check their instagram: https://www.instagram.com/enter.the.butcher/
If you may remember I painted a star ship for this warband, the Iron Maw, on which they crusade the Galaxy: https://www.artstation.com/artwork/g00LWe This artwork shows a pretty special part of this ship called The Daemonastrolabium. Basically it’s a huge compass which navigates the warp.
A shared effort by the Iron Butchers Warpsmith and Dark Mechanicum Hereteks, the Daemonastrolabium is a huge, daemonic device located in the highest spire of the observatory dome of the Iron Maw. The device, commonly known as daemon-compass, is a creation whose goal was to allow the Iron Butchers to perform warp-travel without the need of a Navigator, since the latter are rare individuals, often prone to madness or death, due to the nature of the Chaos, or unwilling to help traitor Warbands.

A tomb has awakened releasing it’s dormant horrors… Necrons is a special art subject for me. I did my first tries on them about 3-4 years. And what is special ever since my artistic vision of them has been changing several times. Of course the first attempts were pretty clumsy and some next art then became more mature. Nevertheless Necrons though humanoid yet distinctly different from humans at their primal form before the transfer. And the main challenge I think is to grasp this difference and be able to express it along with mean consequences of the transfer. This challenging aspect and a strong undead vibe keep inspiring me.
