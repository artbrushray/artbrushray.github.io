      <description>Mix of my artworks October 2023.
Decided to paint some skeletons One part Sepulchral Guard, one part Son of Velmorn.
This time I was inspired by the miniature (Venomcrawler) of this monster and painted the fan art of the creature in its den in Nurgle style.
Also a few figure studies I turned into magicians.

      <description>Mix of my recent artworks.
A tomb has awakened releasing it&amp;rsquo;s dormant horrors&amp;hellip; Necrons is a special art subject for me. I did my first tries on them about 3-4 years. And what is special ever since my artistic vision of them has been changing several times. Of course the first attempts were pretty clumsy and some next art then became more mature. Nevertheless Necrons though humanoid yet distinctly different from humans at their primal form before the transfer.</description>

      <description>Hey everyone! This is another revamp of one of my work. The first art of this character was painted something about a year ago for the Iron Butchers warband: https://www.instagram.com/enter.the.butcher/ Here is the link to the post with the first version of Culsu: https://www.artstation.com/artwork/6bXRxV
Then there had been some progress in my vision and work process and we decided to make another art ot the character. So this post is the result: a character with helmet and without, plus some stages.</description>
