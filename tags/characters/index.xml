&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AdMech vs some Heretics fan art&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://artbrushray.github.io/img/2025/Mechanicus-vs-heretics-by-brushray-h.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;AdMech vs some Heretics fan art, fan art by Dmitry Brushray&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone!
What I love about AdMech is that if a hand or leg a bit longer than it should be, it&amp;rsquo;s not a problem it&amp;rsquo;s an AdMech thing, you know.
So yeh, scale might be a little bit off. However I wanted to paint a titan and a dunecrawler in a single battle scene. I hope you like it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lord Krios the Siegebreaker&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://artbrushray.github.io/img/2024/Lord-Krios-by-brushray-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Lord Krios the Siegebreaker, fan art by Dmitry Brushray&#34;  /&gt;

Had a chance recently to paint some more chaos terminators.
This time is a terminator chaos lord of a custom warband.
He&amp;rsquo;s a former Iron Warrior that joined a Word Bearers warband called the Doomed. The image was painted from miniature reference: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/p/CwSXAkUtRiV/&#34;&gt;https://www.instagram.com/p/CwSXAkUtRiV/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And more description taken from there:
Poliorkitikos Krios, a former Iron Warrior who joined the ranks of The Doomed warband, has rapidly risen through the command structure when the warband found its combat doctrine lacking in battles of attrition.
In times of need Krios is elevated to the rank of Lord Commander but outside campaigns he prefers to go by his Council title &amp;ldquo;Lord of Siege&amp;rdquo;.
His equipment includes:
indomitus-pattern terminator armor salvaged from a slain Imperial Fist captain
standard combi-melta with self-calibrating combat optics feeding directly into a split ocular nerve
Bane of Bulwarks, a sonic thunderhammer crafted by 𝙙𝙖𝙩𝙖 𝙘𝙤𝙧𝙧𝙪𝙥𝙩𝙚𝙙. The impact of each hit is so severe Krios had to retrofit a powerfist to absorb the raw kinetic force able to rip an astartes arm open.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
