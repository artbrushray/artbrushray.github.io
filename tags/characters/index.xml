      <description>Mix of my artworks June 2024.
Lord Krios the Siegebreaker Had a chance recently to paint some more chaos terminators. This time is a terminator chaos lord of a custom warband. He&amp;rsquo;s a former Iron Warrior that joined a Word Bearers warband called the Doomed. The image was painted from miniature reference: https://www.instagram.com/p/CwSXAkUtRiV/
And more description taken from there: Poliorkitikos Krios, a former Iron Warrior who joined the ranks of The Doomed warband, has rapidly risen through the command structure when the warband found its combat doctrine lacking in battles of attrition.</description>

      <description>Hey everyone! Today I want to show you something really special. Ever since I started painting Warhammer fan art for many reasons I hadn&amp;rsquo;t been dared to think of approaching this potent figure, the Emperor of mankind. Besides required strong artistic skills one important reason was that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see any good idea or a context to show him.
Then it has come pretty sudden, I guess it could be called an inspiration.</description>

      <title>Revamp of the ugliest fan art I ever painted, Necron Lord</title>

      <description>Recently I picked this idea of repainting my old art. It helps to spot some problems and estimate my current progress. After making few revamps I decided to pick I guess one of my biggest fails. Every time I see the initial art I had made, it reminds me horrors of the warp. I still don&amp;rsquo;t know how it happened, after all I wasn&amp;rsquo;t that bad at that time but with this fan art something went really wrong.</description>
