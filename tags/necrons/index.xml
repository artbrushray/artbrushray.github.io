      <title>Revamp of the ugliest fan art I ever painted, Necron Lord</title>

Recently I picked this idea of repainting my old art. It helps to spot some problems and estimate my current progress. After making few revamps I decided to pick I guess one of my biggest fails. Every time I see the initial art I had made, it reminds me horrors of the warp. I still don&amp;rsquo;t know how it happened, after all I wasn&amp;rsquo;t that bad at that time but with this fan art something went really wrong. Perhaps I was too much taken away with details or Necrons and the idea itself that I ditched out nearly everything that&amp;rsquo;s important to make a drawing looking good.

This new version is not perfect either but it makes difference and sure thing a progress which adds motivation to keep pushing my progress. I want this work not to be a show off but rather an example of motivation for me and everyone who learn and struggle with results. So this concludes two things: patience and efforts one way or another will give results, the more you systematic the sooner and the better they will be; fails are important and not a big drama as against them the progress and results are visible. I hope you progress at what you are keen and enthusiastic!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mix of my artworks November 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

I keep painting chaos space marines. This guy has pretty unusual and bright colour scheme. He&amp;rsquo;s a chaos champion for a warband called the Reproached Hollows, He&amp;rsquo;s only known as &amp;ldquo;The Cyclopes&amp;rdquo;
Special thanks to Littlerevy and her miniature reference:

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey everybody! &lt;br&gt;
In this work I was inspired by the marvellous game Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus.&lt;br&gt;
The intro still makes me shiver. Adeptus Mechanicus one of my favourite topics to paint.&lt;/p&gt;
