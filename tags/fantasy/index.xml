      <description>Mix of my artworks November 2023.
I keep painting chaos space marines. This guy has pretty unusual and bright colour scheme. He&amp;rsquo;s a chaos champion for a warband called the Reproached Hollows, He&amp;rsquo;s only known as &amp;ldquo;The Cyclopes&amp;rdquo; Special thanks to Littlerevy and her miniature reference: https://instagram.com/littlerevy?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
Roman warrior, short personal work, a painting study
In this personal work called &amp;ldquo;Lady Victory&amp;rdquo; I was inspired by knights and medieval, fantasy vibes.</description>

      <description>Mix of my artworks October 2023.
Decided to paint some skeletons One part Sepulchral Guard, one part Son of Velmorn.
This time I was inspired by the miniature (Venomcrawler) of this monster and painted the fan art of the creature in its den in Nurgle style.
Also a few figure studies I turned into magicians.

      <description>Character for Live action role play. Wolfram is a druid sheriff, whose connection with nature is unbreakable. His bark wood metal armor was crafted by the ancient trees of the forest, and it has become a part of him. As he moves, the armor rustles like the leaves in the wind. He wields a short, thick sword with a sharp edge, forged from the bones of the earth itself. His shield, crafted from the finest wood, is round and engraved with intricate patterns.</description>
