I keep painting chaos space marines. This guy has pretty unusual and bright colour scheme. He&amp;rsquo;s a chaos champion for a warband called the Reproached Hollows, He&amp;rsquo;s only known as &amp;ldquo;The Cyclopes&amp;rdquo;
Special thanks to Littlerevy and her miniature reference:

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Character for Live action role play.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wolfram is a druid sheriff, whose connection with nature is unbreakable. His bark wood metal armor was crafted by the ancient trees of the forest, and it has become a part of him. As he moves, the armor rustles like the leaves in the wind. He wields a short, thick sword with a sharp edge, forged from the bones of the earth itself. His shield, crafted from the finest wood, is round and engraved with intricate patterns.
Wolfram&amp;rsquo;s eyes glimmer with a fierce determination as he faces off against the bandits in the forest, defending the natural order from those who would disturb it. He moves with the grace of a predator, his steps light and swift, as he unleashes his full fury upon his foes. With each strike of his sword and each parry of his shield, Wolfram shows the bandits that they have made a grave mistake in crossing him. He is the protector of the forest, and he will stop at nothing to defend it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
