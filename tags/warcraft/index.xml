      <description>Hi everyone!
I want to show you my new Warcraft fan art and to tell a small story behind it.
My love to computer games started with Starcraft. Later then when I discovered digital art, Starcraft and Warcraft were among the major sources of inspiration
Needless to say I raved about the idea of making art for the Blizzard&amp;hellip; many did. But man, how good one have to be to work with them.</description>
