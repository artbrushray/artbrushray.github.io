      <description>Hey everyone! Today I want to show you something really special. Ever since I started painting Warhammer fan art for many reasons I hadn&amp;rsquo;t been dared to think of approaching this potent figure, the Emperor of mankind. Besides required strong artistic skills one important reason was that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see any good idea or a context to show him.
Then it has come pretty sudden, I guess it could be called an inspiration.</description>
