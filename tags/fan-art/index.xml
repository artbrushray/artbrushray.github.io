      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mix of my recent artworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://artbrushray.github.io/img/2023/SkorpekhLord.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Skorpekh Necron Lord, art by Dmitry Brushray&#34;  /&gt;

A tomb has awakened releasing it&amp;rsquo;s dormant horrors&amp;hellip;
Necrons is a special art subject for me. I did my first tries on them about 3-4 years. And what is special ever since my artistic vision of them has been changing several times. Of course the first attempts were pretty clumsy and some next art then became more mature. Nevertheless Necrons though humanoid yet distinctly different from humans at their primal form before the transfer. And the main challenge I think is to grasp this difference and be able to express it along with mean consequences of the transfer. This challenging aspect and a strong undead vibe keep inspiring me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
