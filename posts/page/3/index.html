    <h2>Iron Butchers preparations for a battle, plus a story.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Hi everybody! Today I have another special piece of art to show you in collaboration with the Iron Butchers: https://www.instagram.com/enter.the.butcher/ We’ve seen plenty of art and video how space marines are served and prepared for a battle. All these are about loyal astartes. Correct me, but I’ve never seen an art where renegades or chaos marines are served. It may be some of them no need such procedure as they fused with their armor. But I think there are warbands and space marines which are less corrupted by chaos and still needed this service every once in a while. So we thought it would be interesting to imagine how ironclading could look like for ChSM. And today I’m happy to show you the result along with the small description below. Pls have fun!

    <h2>Eyedropper tool lag in Photoshop
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Every artist who uses Photoshop for painting knows eyedropper color picker is the most important and essential tool. I’ve been using Photoshop for 15 years and all this time there was something wrong with this tool. From version to version of the program it always felt like lagging and never picking color as quickly as necessary.
At some point I had put up with the the problem just slowing down the work process until recently I finally found out the cause of the problem. It was so ridiculously obvious that I still feel shame!

    <p>Hey everybody! This work is pretty special, a bit more that a year ago form this art I started my collaboration with Iron Butchers warband: https://www.instagram.com/enter.the.butcher/ Back then I did the first version of this art: https://www.artstation.com/artwork/2qn9qg Since then I’ve painted a lot of great art for the Iron Butchers. I learned a lot and improved. Now I thought the time has come to revamp the art. I hope you like the new version of Vhorrax, Iron Warriors Warsmith. Plus, enjoy the lore behind this picture:

Warsmith Vhorrax Immanibus, leader of the Iron Butchers, contemplates the birth of the monstrous daemon engine called “the Megatherion”.
Crafted by the combined efforts of the Dark Mechanicum and the Warband’s Warpsmiths, the Megatherion is a knight-sized monstrosity inhabited by not one, but dozens of daemons.

    <h2>Druid sherif
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Character for Live action role play. Wolfram is a druid sheriff, whose connection with nature is unbreakable. His bark wood metal armor was crafted by the ancient trees of the forest, and it has become a part of him. As he moves, the armor rustles like the leaves in the wind. He wields a short, thick sword with a sharp edge, forged from the bones of the earth itself. His shield, crafted from the finest wood, is round and engraved with intricate patterns. Wolfram’s eyes glimmer with a fierce determination as he faces off against the bandits in the forest, defending the natural order from those who would disturb it. He moves with the grace of a predator, his steps light and swift, as he unleashes his full fury upon his foes. With each strike of his sword and each parry of his shield, Wolfram shows the bandits that they have made a grave mistake in crossing him. He is the protector of the forest, and he will stop at nothing to defend it.

    <h2>Rot and Iron
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Small story which the art illustrates:
His wasn’t supposed to happen for the Blightstars to now be locked in a small-scale conflict with their former allies, the Rust Corps. All from a single, stray shell. The Blightstars, in their attempt to soften the Imperial forces, had deployed plagueburst crawlers to fire artillery upon the loyalist lines. How could they have known that the manic beast known as Ferrinox was running rampant on the front lines or that one of the many shots fired from their mortars would strike upon his position? Whilst relatively unscathed from the detonation, the hit angered the raving machine who promptly began to slaughter the brothers of the Blightstars. Not even blessed Grandfather’s gifts could help them survive when faced with the armaments of this rampaging beast. Many of the Iron warriors of the Rust Corps join in with the daemonic Ferrinox without hesitation, turning their weapons upon their former allies. The infighting gave the loyalist forces the time they needed to withdraw from the battle field.
The tide of Iron crashed upon the Children of Grandfather Nurgle. For a time, it seemed that the Blightstars would be eradicated. However, hope came in the form of their most blessed and praised kin. Morbus Interitus, who through his devotion was reshaped and graced with a thousand gifts from the Garden of Nurgle. “I shall hold this mindless automata while you collect yourselves, brothers!” The voice came through as a deep rumble like the aftershock of an explosion. Morbus stood his ground as the earth around began to warp in his mere presence. Noxus fumes and fungal death heads grew from the ground as life withered, died, and regrew in seconds at his feet. The beast Ferrinox, drawn by this new threat, fell upon the Champion like a storm of steel. Within microseconds, the metal abomination slammed into Morbus.
Black smog and decaying biomatter erupted from the impact shrouding both monsters. There was a lull in the fighting as both sides waited to see what had become of their champions. Moments passed. Then the cloud swirled as Ferriox was thrown clear, landing and obliterating a trio of Iron Warriors. The abomination howled with fury as he pulled himself from the ground.
“Be blessed, creature, for thou shalt bare witness to the gifts of Grandfather Nurgle,” said a deep, gurgling voice as Morbus strode from the cloud.
“I will rend you apart!” roared the enraged machine, it’s voice a distorted shriek in stark contrast. Ferrinox ripped an unfortunate legionary of the Rust Corps from the ground and heaved him at prince of Nurgle, who effortlessly sliced the marine in twain with his ancient scythe.A wet, bemused chuckle rumbled from deep within his chest. Ferrinox crouched low like a predatory creature and propelled himself forth under the power of jagged thrusters. Claw met scythe, daemonic energies superheating the very air itself in a maelstrom of unabated malice. Caustic fumes ate the daemonic automata, a hailstorm of bullets shredded morbus’ armour, sending chunks of putrid flesh into the air. And yet, neither side seemed to gain any advantage over the other. Ferrinox was naught but a blur, his offensive a sight to behold. Yet Morbus was blessed with a near undying resilience, letting the Prince weather the storm.
Ferrinox manage to plunge his twisted claw into the belly of Morbus, who gave a unsettling bellowing laugh as his many tendrils began to wrap around the wicked Machine. The Beast of the Rust Corps screamed in rage as he slammed his cannon on the daemon prince’s face over and over, attempting to weaken his grasp. “DIE! DIE! DIE!” howled the machine. In a last desperate attempt to free himself, Ferrinox planted his feet into the ground. The deamon prince of the Rust Corps heaved his foe into the air, embracing him in his crushing grip. A beat. Then, a Sinister Red glow began to burn from Ferrinox’s core.
“Fall back, fall back!” was shouted from the many voices of the Iron warriors still left as they began to desperately scramble away. And then, burning with the fury of a dying star, a beam of pure red energy erupted from Ferriox, engulfing he and his foe…
