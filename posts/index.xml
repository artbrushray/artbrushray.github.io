      <description>Recently I picked this idea of repainting my old art. It helps to spot some problems and estimate my current progress. After making few revamps I decided to pick I guess one of my biggest fails. Every time I see the initial art I had made, it reminds me horrors of the warp. I still don&amp;rsquo;t know how it happened, after all I wasn&amp;rsquo;t that bad at that time but with this fan art something went really wrong.</description>

      <description>Mix of my artworks November 2023.
I keep painting chaos space marines. This guy has pretty unusual and bright colour scheme. He&amp;rsquo;s a chaos champion for a warband called the Reproached Hollows, He&amp;rsquo;s only known as &amp;ldquo;The Cyclopes&amp;rdquo; Special thanks to Littlerevy and her miniature reference: https://instagram.com/littlerevy?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
Roman warrior, short personal work, a painting study
In this personal work called &amp;ldquo;Lady Victory&amp;rdquo; I was inspired by knights and medieval, fantasy vibes.</description>

      <description>Hey everyone! Today is a special artwork on Warhammer40k here. We keep expanding lore of the Iron Butchers warband: Make sure to check their instagram: https://www.instagram.com/enter.the.butcher/
If you may remember I painted a star ship for this warband, the Iron Maw, on which they crusade the Galaxy: https://www.artstation.com/artwork/g00LWe This artwork shows a pretty special part of this ship called The Daemonastrolabium. Basically it&amp;rsquo;s a huge compass which navigates the warp.</description>

      <description>Mix of my artworks October 2023.
Decided to paint some skeletons One part Sepulchral Guard, one part Son of Velmorn.
This time I was inspired by the miniature (Venomcrawler) of this monster and painted the fan art of the creature in its den in Nurgle style.
Also a few figure studies I turned into magicians.
