Today I have another special piece of art to show you in collaboration with the Iron Butchers: https://www.instagram.com/enter.the.butcher/ We\u0026rsquo;ve seen plenty of art and video how space marines are served and prepared for a battle. All these are about loyal astartes. Correct me, but I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen an art where renegades or chaos marines are served. It may be some of them no need such procedure as they fused with their armor. But I think there are warbands and space marines which are less corrupted by chaos and still needed this service every once in a while. So we thought it would be interesting to imagine how ironclading could look like for ChSM. And today I\u0026rsquo;m happy to show you the result along with the small description below. Pls have fun!\nThe Story *The armoring chamber air was thick with the smell of smoke, oil, and the sweat of both humans and Astartes: the first was almost reassuring with its familiarity, while the second triggered a primordial sense of danger in the human brain, with its unusual combination of chemical and bestial.\nTarraco has just finished attending the armoring process of Kerrah, the World Eater, which was now being presented with his weapons, oiled and ready, and was now welding together some plates of Iron Warrior Odross armor. Unlikely what Tarraco imagined the armoring within a Chapter of Astartes loyal to the Emperor could be, this was not a ritualized and standardized process.\nDespite their opposition to physical mutations, and so their few amounts of them, not two Marines were identical within the Iron Butchers Warband, and their equipment was similarly unique. The armors could be new or old, whole or patched with parts of power armors of different patterns, and the body of the marine was even more unique. Kerrah skin, as an example, was blessed by Khorne and turned into a callous hide as thick as grox\u0026rsquo;s skin that used to regenerate so fast that the power armor\u0026rsquo;s connections on his chest were covered in skin between the battles, this required the serfs\u0026hellip;or slaves\u0026hellip;to cut open the plugs each time with scalpels and drills, minding not damaging the port below.\nOdross, on the other hand, has connection cables forever fused to his plugs, so the power armor needed to be connected to the cables, instead of directly to the body of the Marine. His armour also needed to be welded in place at more than one point, as the different MK pattern didn\u0026rsquo;t fit properly and couldn\u0026rsquo;t be just simply put together.\nTarraco had to remember and replicate the exact process for each Marine he was in charge of and replicate it without any error. The armoring servitors, forever imprisoned in the wall\u0026rsquo;s alcoves, were a grim reminder of the fate that awaited those who failed to attend to their duty flawlessly.*\nI\u0026rsquo;m open for art commissions and happy to paint something for you.

I\u0026rsquo;ve been using Photoshop for 15 years and all this time there was something wrong with this tool. From version to version of the program it always felt like lagging and never picking color as quickly as necessary.\nAt some point I had put up with the the problem just slowing down the work process until recently I finally found out the cause of the problem. It was so ridiculously obvious that I still feel shame!\nIn the internet you\u0026rsquo;ll find tons of information how to optimize Photoshop but non tell the most obvious reason of micro delays using eyedropper tool, no matter how fast your computer is.\nThe fact is that eyedropper tool assigned to Alt key. The fist and the most essential function of this key on Windows OC is selection of main menu in any Windows application. So before it even gets to the eyedropper tool Alt selects menu in Photoshop. You can see it when File Edit Image\u0026hellip; menu become underlined then highlighted. And only after this if Alt is still pressed Photoshop changes Brush tool to Eyedropper tool. All this cause small lags, color misspicking and a lot of irritation because the procedure is iterated a lot.\nAnd this bug unfortunately can\u0026rsquo;t be avoided by regular methods. Neither Photoshop not Windows allow To reassign this Alt key. However there is an external solution. You can use Autohotkey script to turn the menu selection of in Photoshop. Here is the code for the script:\n#IfWinActive ahk_class Photoshop\r~LAlt::\rSendinput {Blind}{sc0E9}\rKeyWait, LAlt ; this wasit for the key to be RELEASED. So that it doesn\u0026#39;t keep spamming SC0E9 (as seen from an AHK window Key history and script info... window.)\rSendinput {Blind}{sc0EA}\rreturn\r~RAlt::\rSendinput {Blind}{sc0E9}\rKeyWait, RAlt ; so that it doesn\u0026#39;t keep spamming SC0E9\rSendinput {Blind}{sc0EA}\rreturn Thank you for the original article: https://github.com/TaranVH/2nd-keyboard/blob/master/Taran's_Windows_Mods/Alt_menu_acceleration_DISABLER.ahk\nI hope it will help to improve your experience in drawing with Photoshop.\n#brushray #artbrushray #artist #art #photoshop #eyedropper #lag #delay #problem #solution #process #drawing #slow\nLike my work?

This work is pretty special, a bit more that a year ago form this art I started my collaboration with Iron Butchers warband: https://www.instagram.com/enter.the.butcher/ Back then I did the first version of this art: https://www.artstation.com/artwork/2qn9qg Since then I\u0026rsquo;ve painted a lot of great art for the Iron Butchers. I learned a lot and improved. Now I thought the time has come to revamp the art. I hope you like the new version of Vhorrax, Iron Warriors Warsmith. Plus, enjoy the lore behind this picture:\nThe Warsmith stepped on the carcass of the Night Lord Dreadnought. A sizzling mixture of blood, amniotic fluid, and oil sputtered from the open wound in the sarcophagus where the sawblades of Corpse Grinder had shredded the metallic hull of the war machine, allowing Vhorrax to flood the Dreadnought bowels with a rain of promethium of his heavy flamer, burning the Dreadnought pilot alive.\nThe Night Lord outpost was minutes away from being conquered, but the VIIIth Legion has put such a hard fight that he had to step into the battlefield in first person.\nWhile their fearmongering doctrine was ineffective against the Astartes, they had plagued the Iron Butchers for a week with fast strikes and retreats, causing the Khornates significant losses. Finally, Vhorrax had pinpointed their location and led the final, direct onslaught. In that, the Iron Butchers were second to none, as the Night Lords have experienced.\nOn his right, a World Eaters Terminator was starting harvesting the skulls of the enemies, finally free to enjoy the pure flesh-tearing ecstasy without any thought about discipline and orders.\nInside his brain, he started feeling the urge to join his subordinate in a feast of skulls and blood to honor the Blood Father, but he had to resist. Vhorrax kept referring to the thing inside his head as \u0026ldquo;his brain\u0026rdquo;, but he wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure about that anymore. Only the Gods knew what kind of organ existed inside him after Khorne has turned his whole body into a mechanical nightmare, forever flesh-fused with the Cataphrachtii armour.\nThe Warsmith breathed burning air from his mouth grille. The Blood Father\u0026rsquo;s influence was growing stronger, asking him to indulge in the pleasure of the blood, shredding the survivors with his chainhammer and taking their skulls for the skull throne. But he resisted, he knew he had to listen to the IVth Legion\u0026rsquo;s rational nature, or they were lost: the battle was won but more has to be done. They had to choose between fortifying the conquered settlement and staying in to drain the area from all the resources, or flee with just what they have plundered, leaving precious resources behind but limiting the risk of being found by other enemies. The Warsmith decision process wasn\u0026rsquo;t based on warp-trickery as other Warbands did. They had not any sorcerer or prophet, cause the Warsmith trusted only cold logic.\nAll the available data regarding the outpost, the battle, and the resources have to be scanned and registered by the data-servitor of the Mechanicum, then elaborated to find all the possible correlations to determine the best course of action to continue the Endless War.\nOnly keeping the Iron Within, he could keep the blood flowing throughout in an endless stream for the Blood God.\n#warhammer40k #warhammer40000 #warhammer #warhammerart #warhammercommunity #wh40k #40k #ironwarriors #astartes #spacemarine #terminator #robot #robotic #monster #future #grimdak #fantasy #fiction #illustration #chaos40k #cg #horusheresy #k #warband #remastered #brushray #artbrushray #artist #art\nLike my work?

All from a single, stray shell. The Blightstars, in their attempt to soften the Imperial forces, had deployed plagueburst crawlers to fire artillery upon the loyalist lines. How could they have known that the manic beast known as Ferrinox was running rampant on the front lines or that one of the many shots fired from their mortars would strike upon his position? Whilst relatively unscathed from the detonation, the hit angered the raving machine who promptly began to slaughter the brothers of the Blightstars. Not even blessed Grandfather\u0026rsquo;s gifts could help them survive when faced with the armaments of this rampaging beast. Many of the Iron warriors of the Rust Corps join in with the daemonic Ferrinox without hesitation, turning their weapons upon their former allies. The infighting gave the loyalist forces the time they needed to withdraw from the battle field.\nThe tide of Iron crashed upon the Children of Grandfather Nurgle. For a time, it seemed that the Blightstars would be eradicated. However, hope came in the form of their most blessed and praised kin. Morbus Interitus, who through his devotion was reshaped and graced with a thousand gifts from the Garden of Nurgle. \u0026ldquo;I shall hold this mindless automata while you collect yourselves, brothers!\u0026rdquo; The voice came through as a deep rumble like the aftershock of an explosion. Morbus stood his ground as the earth around began to warp in his mere presence. Noxus fumes and fungal death heads grew from the ground as life withered, died, and regrew in seconds at his feet. The beast Ferrinox, drawn by this new threat, fell upon the Champion like a storm of steel. Within microseconds, the metal abomination slammed into Morbus.\nBlack smog and decaying biomatter erupted from the impact shrouding both monsters. There was a lull in the fighting as both sides waited to see what had become of their champions. Moments passed. Then the cloud swirled as Ferriox was thrown clear, landing and obliterating a trio of Iron Warriors. The abomination howled with fury as he pulled himself from the ground.\n\u0026ldquo;Be blessed, creature, for thou shalt bare witness to the gifts of Grandfather Nurgle,\u0026rdquo; said a deep, gurgling voice as Morbus strode from the cloud.\n\u0026ldquo;I will rend you apart!\u0026rdquo; roared the enraged machine, it\u0026rsquo;s voice a distorted shriek in stark contrast. Ferrinox ripped an unfortunate legionary of the Rust Corps from the ground and heaved him at prince of Nurgle, who effortlessly sliced the marine in twain with his ancient scythe.A wet, bemused chuckle rumbled from deep within his chest. Ferrinox crouched low like a predatory creature and propelled himself forth under the power of jagged thrusters. Claw met scythe, daemonic energies superheating the very air itself in a maelstrom of unabated malice. Caustic fumes ate the daemonic automata, a hailstorm of bullets shredded morbus\u0026rsquo; armour, sending chunks of putrid flesh into the air. And yet, neither side seemed to gain any advantage over the other. Ferrinox was naught but a blur, his offensive a sight to behold. Yet Morbus was blessed with a near undying resilience, letting the Prince weather the storm.\nFerrinox manage to plunge his twisted claw into the belly of Morbus, who gave a unsettling bellowing laugh as his many tendrils began to wrap around the wicked Machine. The Beast of the Rust Corps screamed in rage as he slammed his cannon on the daemon prince\u0026rsquo;s face over and over, attempting to weaken his grasp. \u0026ldquo;DIE! DIE! DIE!\u0026rdquo; howled the machine. In a last desperate attempt to free himself, Ferrinox planted his feet into the ground. The deamon prince of the Rust Corps heaved his foe into the air, embracing him in his crushing grip. A beat. Then, a Sinister Red glow began to burn from Ferrinox\u0026rsquo;s core.\n\u0026ldquo;Fall back, fall back!\u0026rdquo; was shouted from the many voices of the Iron warriors still left as they began to desperately scramble away. And then, burning with the fury of a dying star, a beam of pure red energy erupted from Ferriox, engulfing he and his foe…\n#warhammer40k #warhammer #warhammerart #warhammercommunity #wh40k #40k #brushray #artbrushray #chaos #spacemarine #astartes #warband #story #nurgle #ironwarriors #chaos40k\nLike my work?
