[{"content":"Hey everyone! Today I want to show you something really special. Ever since I started painting Warhammer fan art for many reasons I hadn\u0026rsquo;t been dared to think of approaching this potent figure, the Emperor of mankind. Besides required strong artistic skills one important reason was that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t see any good idea or a context to show him.\nThen it has come pretty sudden, I guess it could be called an inspiration. First I realised his might could be shown only in comparison with some other objects or characters. I wanted to add astartes to his side but then I thought their size and anatomy indistinct too so instead I decided to add people. Small and puny as they are they became a great contrast to his scale, and it benefited for the further idea progress. At once a context stuck to the idea: he reveals his nature to these two poor souls. Librarians let them be, an old man and a young woman. The old man just can\u0026rsquo;t stand the Emperor side. The woman is a mild psyker so she is more sensitive. He begs her to turn her gaze down but she is ecstatic. She feels the Emperor\u0026rsquo;s might is unbearable and yet she can\u0026rsquo;t not to watch.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s only for a fraction of moment he reveals himself. His colossal figure cut in two with light and shadow. In darkness lays his psychic power: he is the wall protecting people from the horrors of the warp and he is the keystone of galactic travels. In light lives his physical manifestation: a gigantic undefeatable warrior clad in gold, the emperor – union and true leader of mankind. Next moment he\u0026rsquo;ll step to the light of day carrying his more human features and the revelation will be gone.\nThis work as dramatic as it is was emotionally draining but I\u0026rsquo;m glad I got enough strength to finish and to show it to you. Eventually I think it\u0026rsquo;s good to show him to you in some interesting unusual manner.\nPoster size image:\nSoon will be more art.\nHave a good time!\n#brushray #artbrushray #artist #art #painting #artcommissions #buyart #Warhammer40k #WarhammerCommunity #Warhammer #WarhammerArt #Wh40k #40k #30k #theemperor #theemperorofmankind #emperor #imperium #terra #horusheresy #Wargaming #hobby #grimdark #TabletopGaming #tabletop #games #geeks #brushray #Epic #space #warp #armor #fantasy #psyker #heroic\nLike my work?

It helps to spot some problems and estimate my current progress. After making few revamps I decided to pick I guess one of my biggest fails. Every time I see the initial art I had made, it reminds me horrors of the warp. I still don\u0026rsquo;t know how it happened, after all I wasn\u0026rsquo;t that bad at that time but with this fan art something went really wrong. Perhaps I was too much taken away with details or Necrons and the idea itself that I ditched out nearly everything that\u0026rsquo;s important to make a drawing looking good. This new version is not perfect either but it makes difference and sure thing a progress which adds motivation to keep pushing my progress. I want this work not to be a show off but rather an example of motivation for me and everyone who learn and struggle with results. So this concludes two things: patience and efforts one way or another will give results, the more you systematic the sooner and the better they will be; fails are important and not a big drama as against them the progress and results are visible.

Today is a special artwork on Warhammer40k here. We keep expanding lore of the Iron Butchers warband: Make sure to check their instagram: https://www.instagram.com/enter.the.butcher/\nIf you may remember I painted a star ship for this warband, the Iron Maw, on which they crusade the Galaxy: https://www.artstation.com/artwork/g00LWe This artwork shows a pretty special part of this ship called The Daemonastrolabium. Basically it\u0026rsquo;s a huge compass which navigates the warp.\nA shared effort by the Iron Butchers Warpsmith and Dark Mechanicum Hereteks, the Daemonastrolabium is a huge, daemonic device located in the highest spire of the observatory dome of the Iron Maw. The device, commonly known as daemon-compass, is a creation whose goal was to allow the Iron Butchers to perform warp-travel without the need of a Navigator, since the latter are rare individuals, often prone to madness or death, due to the nature of the Chaos, or unwilling to help traitor Warbands.\nThe Daemonastrolabium exploits the power of a trapped Slaaneshi daemon, a Lady of the Void lured into a trap by Warpsmith Varago himself, to navigate the Immaterium. The Lady of the Void is forced, by a series of punishments and rewards, to communicate to the proper device the path and the currents of the Immaterium as it sees them. Since that information is unintelligible for any human to understand, the device translates them into machine code, and then the Mechanicum Calculus Logis interprets the data to calculate and insert the right route through the Warp to come out in the corresponding place in the realspace. While this method allows the Iron Butchers to not rely on kidnapped navigators or free-roaming daemons, is still not without flaws.\nThe whole operation is extremely risky, as Varago needs to control and appease the daemon in order to prevent it from breaking free. The daemon is kept, during its slumber in a status of sensorial deprivation, and oppressed by the connection with the remnants of psychic blanks kept alive in nearby sarcophagi. Awakening the Lady of the Void requires human sacrifices to appease her thirst, and more and more sacrifices are needed during the navigation to ensure her ongoing collaboration. Performing the navigation under such circumstances is not easy, and on more than one occasion the exit point has been all but precise, either due to some wrong calculus or the tricks of the daemon. Still, the navigation with the Daemonastrolabium proved to be way more reliable than any standard calculated jump, freeing the Iron Butchers from the need for Imperial Navigators.\nI hope you enjoy the artwork!

I did my first tries on them about 3-4 years. And what is special ever since my artistic vision of them has been changing several times. Of course the first attempts were pretty clumsy and some next art then became more mature. Nevertheless Necrons though humanoid yet distinctly different from humans at their primal form before the transfer. And the main challenge I think is to grasp this difference and be able to express it along with mean consequences of the transfer. This challenging aspect and a strong undead vibe keep inspiring me.\nI painted this Iron Warrior for Monnose\u0026rsquo;s custom warband the Iron Scourge: https://instagram.com/sgt_monnos?igshid=MzNlNGNkZWQ4Mg== He is the leader and his concept is that he uses the tools to create daemon engines in battle, apart from the storm bolter and gatling gun. Here is few more words about the character: Terran-born, Ogdromok has fought for the IVth Legion since the wars of The Great Crusade. He served as a techmarine within the 3rd Grand Battalion and remained in the position until the Dispute of Iron, with the assistance of the Dark Mechanicum, he assumed control and leadership of a large number of marines and vehicles. Adhering to the tenets of the Unbreakable Litany with an almost zealous fervour, he has spread his beliefs throughout the Iron Scourge. The core ideals of the Great Crusade also permeate his mentality, making his outlook one of sheer hatred for anything but humanity. He tolerates no worship of the chaos gods and especially the Emperor.\nNot sure if space marines give up their skulls for such thing but I thought it would be fun to paint another servo skull with a ref to space marine veteran.\nI fancy a renegade Enginseer Kharak Vex. Enginseer Kharak Vex, once a loyal servant of the Adeptus Mechanicus, had succumbed to the insidious temptation of forbidden knowledge. His obsession with unlocking the secrets of xenos technology led him down a path of heresy and betrayal. Bearing the weight of forbidden augmetic enhancements, Kharak now prowled the shadowed underbelly of a sprawling hive city. Disguised beneath layers of ragged robes, he moved undetected amidst the teeming masses. Augmented optics scanned his surroundings, seeking opportunities to exploit the hive\u0026rsquo;s vulnerabilities.\n#brushray #artbrushray #artist #art #painting #artcommissions #buyart #dmitrybrsuhray #fanart\nLike my work?

Charcoal, pencil, pastel,sepia in all variations. I learned to control them and comparing to paints they seemed more friendly and simple to me. I don\u0026rsquo;t need to think about drying layers, mixing colours, distorting paper, fading tones etc. The result with dry media strict and straight, mostly pure form reflected in monotone. One the other hand my aspiration always has been oil painting. When water colours and gouache I simply didn\u0026rsquo;t liked, oils I was afraid of! Dry media was a sort of preparation to use oils and I considered to use them later when my academic skill will be more solid. Adding to this all complications with oil painting techniques such as mediums, priming, colour mixing etc., I kept postponing my meeting with oils and worked with dry media only. Last winter was difficult and full of anxious thoughts. It caused me a sort of burn out and depression. I kept clinging to working and art for nothing much of other options left to keep me afloat. Spring came and brought some relief and along with this a trivial thought that waiting for a perfect moment is a waist of time and futile expectation. I think I was exalting and idealising oil paints too much. May be for some time I was in need of such ideal of a noble stage of the art journey which requires a lot of preparations, as another motivation kind. After these stressing times I had thought that idealising oils is childish, I don\u0026rsquo;t need any particular cause or moment or level to step in. I started from videos at least to sort out technical aspects and it was not too difficult. It\u0026rsquo;s difficult for a perfect results on some heavy art work. But to start bare minimum is like a bunch of brushes, dark warm and dark cold paints plus white (3 tubes in total if to work in monochrome) and a medium to dilute the paint oil or varnish. As a canvas can work anything thick enough and primed in acrylic paint. Actually, I skipped the last point with priming and just used usual office paper for printer with water proof lining to prevent oil from soaking thru paper and spreading around. You can see the result.\nFew words about the experience. I regret I haven\u0026rsquo;t used the oils before. I had my doubts and fears it\u0026rsquo;s expensive and difficult but now I think they are baseless. Certainly to paint fool colours need a pallet of paints, plus canvas and it may cost not cheap. But to start just to feel the material 3 tubes of paint and a bit of sunflower oil is good to go. Plus a nice discover was that the oils is perfectly works with dry media. Charcoal or sepia, it sort of pick them up and mix and give very deep dark shade to mark contrast parts or shapes.\nSo this is it, sort of a big news. I always had been dreaming to use the oils. Since I started drawing due to a number of reasons I couldn\u0026rsquo;t afford it and it become an idea fix. And now I finally decided to make these first steps of which I\u0026rsquo;m happy to tell. For some time I guess I will be adapting to the media as eventually I want to try canvas and full colours. I also keep working in digital. I\u0026rsquo;m eager to see how the oils will affect my digital painting vision but I guess it\u0026rsquo;s not quick to happen. Thank you for everyone who supported and keeps supporting me. You help me to develop as an artist!

The first art of this character was painted something about a year ago for the Iron Butchers warband: https://www.instagram.com/enter.the.butcher/ Here is the link to the post with the first version of Culsu: https://www.artstation.com/artwork/6bXRxV\nThen there had been some progress in my vision and work process and we decided to make another art ot the character. So this post is the result: a character with helmet and without, plus some stages. Here is also some story to make the image more vivid:\nCulsu and his Destroyers waited patiently on the remains of a high building overlooking he wasteland. They knew that the last renegade survivors were hiding somewhere and they would not return to the ship before claiming all their skulls. They have been waiting patiently for hours now, fighting the internal struggles against their bloodlust and the pain of the Butcher\u0026rsquo;s Nails which screamed for murder. Finlly, a maniple of soldiers emerged from a destroyed facility. Culsu aimed his Volkite Serpentia at one of them, releasing a burst of energy that almost severed the man\u0026rsquo;s in two. At that moment, the Destroyers descended upon the enemy squad like vultures on carrion, with Culsu leading the charge.\nDespite being outnumbered three to one, they were no match for the World Eaters. Chainaxes cut through flesh and bone, and Culsu swung his Rageclaw in a frenzy, harvesting lives at each blow. In the end, only one man survived. Culsu stopped his men with a gesture and approached the trembling and fearful man, tasting his fear.\n“Why did you do that?” asked the man “we spat on the Imperium as you did, we could have been your allies”. Culsu scoffed at the idea.\n“Men are such fragile creatures” said Culsu “They are subordinates, never allies. In some occasions we could have make good use of you. But, unlucky, today the only things you are useful for is your blood and skulls.”\nThe man tried to rais his laspistol, but Culsu’s claw was faster, and his head rolled on the ground before he could scream.\nI hope you enjoyed it!\n#brushray #artbrushray #artist #art #painting #artcommissions #buyart #warhammer40k #warhammer40000 #warhammer #warhammerart #WarhammerCommunity #wh40k #40k #fanart #worldeaters #horusheresy #chaos #warp #warpstorm #tabletopgaaming #geek #gaming #hobby #hobbytime #present #gift #wargaming #painting\nLike my work?

Plus here is a bit of story content from Iron Butchers public. Please, enjoy.\nCaptain Heuldrasia was carried on the Command Bridge by her personal servitor. She was cradled in its arms like a baby in the mother\u0026rsquo;s chest. The servitor laid the Captain\u0026rsquo;s mangled body in the Command Throne, and rapidly connected to the ship\u0026rsquo;s systems, allowing her mind to fuse, once more, with the ship\u0026rsquo;s Machine Spirit. Heuldrasia consciousness split in two, one part still aware of her physical surrounding, has communication with the ship\u0026rsquo;s officers couldn\u0026rsquo;t be interrupted, while the other sank in the vessel\u0026rsquo;s core where she met the Machine Spirit again. The Iron Maw essence was a being born to fire and blood, violence and hate, build 10 Millenia before in the forges of Sarum to serve the XIIth Legion, and as the XIIth Legion she slaughtered out of enjoyment, not only duty. But the beast as long ago accepted the guiding hand of Heuldrasia nonetheless, and now welcomed the presence of the Captain, for each was of little worth without the other.\nThe Iron Maw, without her Captain, was only a savage creature, almost impossible to man, while Heuldrasia was, without the Iron Maw, nothing more than a broken, frail husk of a woman, Together, however, they stalked the void, taking lives as they pleased.\nThe Iron Butchers were masters of war for what concerned the ground warfare, and they did well in boarding operations too, Heuldrasia had to admit. But breaking planetary defenses from afar, annihilating another vessel, or even just getting close enough to launch boarding torpedoes was not their field of expertise. In the void, Heuldraisa and the Iron Maw reigned supreme. The officers communicated to Heuldraisa the position of an approaching vessel, probably another renegade who stalked the Expanse. \u0026ldquo;What are the orders\u0026rdquo; asked Heuldrasia to her officers.\n\u0026ldquo;Lord Vhorrax is eager to get to the destination as soon as possible. No boarding operations, ignore all obstacles of destroy them as soon as possible.\nHeuldrasia lips curled.\nShe grew fond of the skull-collecting use of the Iron Butchers so much that she asked for the boarding teams to bring her the heads of the enemy\u0026rsquo;s Captain to ornate her Command station with them. But if orders were to just destroy the ship, of course, there would be no skulls left.\n\u0026ldquo;What a pity\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; thought Heuldrasia.\n\u0026ldquo;All guns be ready.\u0026rdquo; she growled \u0026ldquo;I want to see their husk aflame within minutes.\u0026rdquo;\n#brushray #artbrushray #artist #art #painting #artcommissions #buyart #warhammer40k #warhammer40000 #warhammer #warhammerart #WarhammerCommunity #wh40k #40k #FanArt #IronWarriors #WorldEaters #HorusHeresy #ChaosSpaceMarines #WarpStorm #BattleShip #SciFiArt #FantasyArt #SpaceMarines #TabletopGaming #GrimDark #HobbyTime #Darkness #Chaos #WarhammerFantasy #Wargaming #AdeptusAstartes #PaintingWarhammer #spaceship #battleship\nLike my work?

Today I have another special piece of art to show you in collaboration with the Iron Butchers: https://www.instagram.com/enter.the.butcher/ We\u0026rsquo;ve seen plenty of art and video how space marines are served and prepared for a battle. All these are about loyal astartes. Correct me, but I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen an art where renegades or chaos marines are served. It may be some of them no need such procedure as they fused with their armor. But I think there are warbands and space marines which are less corrupted by chaos and still needed this service every once in a while. So we thought it would be interesting to imagine how ironclading could look like for ChSM. And today I\u0026rsquo;m happy to show you the result along with the small description below. Pls have fun!\nThe Story *The armoring chamber air was thick with the smell of smoke, oil, and the sweat of both humans and Astartes: the first was almost reassuring with its familiarity, while the second triggered a primordial sense of danger in the human brain, with its unusual combination of chemical and bestial.\nTarraco has just finished attending the armoring process of Kerrah, the World Eater, which was now being presented with his weapons, oiled and ready, and was now welding together some plates of Iron Warrior Odross armor. Unlikely what Tarraco imagined the armoring within a Chapter of Astartes loyal to the Emperor could be, this was not a ritualized and standardized process.\nDespite their opposition to physical mutations, and so their few amounts of them, not two Marines were identical within the Iron Butchers Warband, and their equipment was similarly unique. The armors could be new or old, whole or patched with parts of power armors of different patterns, and the body of the marine was even more unique. Kerrah skin, as an example, was blessed by Khorne and turned into a callous hide as thick as grox\u0026rsquo;s skin that used to regenerate so fast that the power armor\u0026rsquo;s connections on his chest were covered in skin between the battles, this required the serfs\u0026hellip;or slaves\u0026hellip;to cut open the plugs each time with scalpels and drills, minding not damaging the port below.\nOdross, on the other hand, has connection cables forever fused to his plugs, so the power armor needed to be connected to the cables, instead of directly to the body of the Marine. His armour also needed to be welded in place at more than one point, as the different MK pattern didn\u0026rsquo;t fit properly and couldn\u0026rsquo;t be just simply put together.\nTarraco had to remember and replicate the exact process for each Marine he was in charge of and replicate it without any error. The armoring servitors, forever imprisoned in the wall\u0026rsquo;s alcoves, were a grim reminder of the fate that awaited those who failed to attend to their duty flawlessly.*\nI\u0026rsquo;m open for art commissions and happy to paint something for you.

I\u0026rsquo;ve been using Photoshop for 15 years and all this time there was something wrong with this tool. From version to version of the program it always felt like lagging and never picking color as quickly as necessary.\nAt some point I had put up with the the problem just slowing down the work process until recently I finally found out the cause of the problem. It was so ridiculously obvious that I still feel shame!\nIn the internet you\u0026rsquo;ll find tons of information how to optimize Photoshop but non tell the most obvious reason of micro delays using eyedropper tool, no matter how fast your computer is.\nThe fact is that eyedropper tool assigned to Alt key. The fist and the most essential function of this key on Windows OC is selection of main menu in any Windows application. So before it even gets to the eyedropper tool Alt selects menu in Photoshop. You can see it when File Edit Image\u0026hellip; menu become underlined then highlighted. And only after this if Alt is still pressed Photoshop changes Brush tool to Eyedropper tool. All this cause small lags, color misspicking and a lot of irritation because the procedure is iterated a lot.\nAnd this bug unfortunately can\u0026rsquo;t be avoided by regular methods. Neither Photoshop not Windows allow To reassign this Alt key. However there is an external solution. You can use Autohotkey script to turn the menu selection of in Photoshop. Here is the code for the script:\n#IfWinActive ahk_class Photoshop\r~LAlt::\rSendinput {Blind}{sc0E9}\rKeyWait, LAlt ; this wasit for the key to be RELEASED. So that it doesn\u0026#39;t keep spamming SC0E9 (as seen from an AHK window Key history and script info... window.)\rSendinput {Blind}{sc0EA}\rreturn\r~RAlt::\rSendinput {Blind}{sc0E9}\rKeyWait, RAlt ; so that it doesn\u0026#39;t keep spamming SC0E9\rSendinput {Blind}{sc0EA}\rreturn Thank you for the original article: https://github.com/TaranVH/2nd-keyboard/blob/master/Taran's_Windows_Mods/Alt_menu_acceleration_DISABLER.ahk\nI hope it will help to improve your experience in drawing with Photoshop.\n#brushray #artbrushray #artist #art #photoshop #eyedropper #lag #delay #problem #solution #process #drawing #slow\nLike my work?

This work is pretty special, a bit more that a year ago form this art I started my collaboration with Iron Butchers warband: https://www.instagram.com/enter.the.butcher/ Back then I did the first version of this art: https://www.artstation.com/artwork/2qn9qg Since then I\u0026rsquo;ve painted a lot of great art for the Iron Butchers. I learned a lot and improved. Now I thought the time has come to revamp the art. I hope you like the new version of Vhorrax, Iron Warriors Warsmith. Plus, enjoy the lore behind this picture:\nThe Warsmith stepped on the carcass of the Night Lord Dreadnought. A sizzling mixture of blood, amniotic fluid, and oil sputtered from the open wound in the sarcophagus where the sawblades of Corpse Grinder had shredded the metallic hull of the war machine, allowing Vhorrax to flood the Dreadnought bowels with a rain of promethium of his heavy flamer, burning the Dreadnought pilot alive.\nThe Night Lord outpost was minutes away from being conquered, but the VIIIth Legion has put such a hard fight that he had to step into the battlefield in first person.\nWhile their fearmongering doctrine was ineffective against the Astartes, they had plagued the Iron Butchers for a week with fast strikes and retreats, causing the Khornates significant losses. Finally, Vhorrax had pinpointed their location and led the final, direct onslaught. In that, the Iron Butchers were second to none, as the Night Lords have experienced.\nOn his right, a World Eaters Terminator was starting harvesting the skulls of the enemies, finally free to enjoy the pure flesh-tearing ecstasy without any thought about discipline and orders.\nInside his brain, he started feeling the urge to join his subordinate in a feast of skulls and blood to honor the Blood Father, but he had to resist. Vhorrax kept referring to the thing inside his head as \u0026ldquo;his brain\u0026rdquo;, but he wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure about that anymore. Only the Gods knew what kind of organ existed inside him after Khorne has turned his whole body into a mechanical nightmare, forever flesh-fused with the Cataphrachtii armour.\nThe Warsmith breathed burning air from his mouth grille. The Blood Father\u0026rsquo;s influence was growing stronger, asking him to indulge in the pleasure of the blood, shredding the survivors with his chainhammer and taking their skulls for the skull throne. But he resisted, he knew he had to listen to the IVth Legion\u0026rsquo;s rational nature, or they were lost: the battle was won but more has to be done. They had to choose between fortifying the conquered settlement and staying in to drain the area from all the resources, or flee with just what they have plundered, leaving precious resources behind but limiting the risk of being found by other enemies. The Warsmith decision process wasn\u0026rsquo;t based on warp-trickery as other Warbands did. They had not any sorcerer or prophet, cause the Warsmith trusted only cold logic.\nAll the available data regarding the outpost, the battle, and the resources have to be scanned and registered by the data-servitor of the Mechanicum, then elaborated to find all the possible correlations to determine the best course of action to continue the Endless War.\nOnly keeping the Iron Within, he could keep the blood flowing throughout in an endless stream for the Blood God.\n#warhammer40k #warhammer40000 #warhammer #warhammerart #warhammercommunity #wh40k #40k #ironwarriors #astartes #spacemarine #terminator #robot #robotic #monster #future #grimdak #fantasy #fiction #illustration #chaos40k #cg #horusheresy #k #warband #remastered #brushray #artbrushray #artist #art\nLike my work?

All from a single, stray shell. The Blightstars, in their attempt to soften the Imperial forces, had deployed plagueburst crawlers to fire artillery upon the loyalist lines. How could they have known that the manic beast known as Ferrinox was running rampant on the front lines or that one of the many shots fired from their mortars would strike upon his position? Whilst relatively unscathed from the detonation, the hit angered the raving machine who promptly began to slaughter the brothers of the Blightstars. Not even blessed Grandfather\u0026rsquo;s gifts could help them survive when faced with the armaments of this rampaging beast. Many of the Iron warriors of the Rust Corps join in with the daemonic Ferrinox without hesitation, turning their weapons upon their former allies. The infighting gave the loyalist forces the time they needed to withdraw from the battle field.\nThe tide of Iron crashed upon the Children of Grandfather Nurgle. For a time, it seemed that the Blightstars would be eradicated. However, hope came in the form of their most blessed and praised kin. Morbus Interitus, who through his devotion was reshaped and graced with a thousand gifts from the Garden of Nurgle. \u0026ldquo;I shall hold this mindless automata while you collect yourselves, brothers!\u0026rdquo; The voice came through as a deep rumble like the aftershock of an explosion. Morbus stood his ground as the earth around began to warp in his mere presence. Noxus fumes and fungal death heads grew from the ground as life withered, died, and regrew in seconds at his feet. The beast Ferrinox, drawn by this new threat, fell upon the Champion like a storm of steel. Within microseconds, the metal abomination slammed into Morbus.\nBlack smog and decaying biomatter erupted from the impact shrouding both monsters. There was a lull in the fighting as both sides waited to see what had become of their champions. Moments passed. Then the cloud swirled as Ferriox was thrown clear, landing and obliterating a trio of Iron Warriors. The abomination howled with fury as he pulled himself from the ground.\n\u0026ldquo;Be blessed, creature, for thou shalt bare witness to the gifts of Grandfather Nurgle,\u0026rdquo; said a deep, gurgling voice as Morbus strode from the cloud.\n\u0026ldquo;I will rend you apart!\u0026rdquo; roared the enraged machine, it\u0026rsquo;s voice a distorted shriek in stark contrast. Ferrinox ripped an unfortunate legionary of the Rust Corps from the ground and heaved him at prince of Nurgle, who effortlessly sliced the marine in twain with his ancient scythe.A wet, bemused chuckle rumbled from deep within his chest. Ferrinox crouched low like a predatory creature and propelled himself forth under the power of jagged thrusters. Claw met scythe, daemonic energies superheating the very air itself in a maelstrom of unabated malice. Caustic fumes ate the daemonic automata, a hailstorm of bullets shredded morbus\u0026rsquo; armour, sending chunks of putrid flesh into the air. And yet, neither side seemed to gain any advantage over the other. Ferrinox was naught but a blur, his offensive a sight to behold. Yet Morbus was blessed with a near undying resilience, letting the Prince weather the storm.\nFerrinox manage to plunge his twisted claw into the belly of Morbus, who gave a unsettling bellowing laugh as his many tendrils began to wrap around the wicked Machine. The Beast of the Rust Corps screamed in rage as he slammed his cannon on the daemon prince\u0026rsquo;s face over and over, attempting to weaken his grasp. \u0026ldquo;DIE! DIE! DIE!\u0026rdquo; howled the machine. In a last desperate attempt to free himself, Ferrinox planted his feet into the ground. The deamon prince of the Rust Corps heaved his foe into the air, embracing him in his crushing grip. A beat. Then, a Sinister Red glow began to burn from Ferrinox\u0026rsquo;s core.\n\u0026ldquo;Fall back, fall back!\u0026rdquo; was shouted from the many voices of the Iron warriors still left as they began to desperately scramble away. And then, burning with the fury of a dying star, a beam of pure red energy erupted from Ferriox, engulfing he and his foe…\n#warhammer40k #warhammer #warhammerart #warhammercommunity #wh40k #40k #brushray #artbrushray #chaos #spacemarine #astartes #warband #story #nurgle #ironwarriors #chaos40k\nLike my work?

Later then when I discovered digital art, Starcraft and Warcraft were among the major sources of inspiration\nNeedless to say I raved about the idea of making art for the Blizzard\u0026hellip; many did. But man, how good one have to be to work with them. It was too much and too big for one small enthusiast who haven\u0026rsquo;t even seen an art school.\nAfter all we have to be realists. And I put up with this and realised there is something else to paint and some other styles to discover.\nI think for 5 years I haven\u0026rsquo;t touched the subject. I was trying to paint girls, animals, some abstract environment, some robotic stuff. But it was never the thing I would love and keep painting for long.\nFinally I discovered Warhammer40k. In many aspects thanks to the big community and feedback I\u0026rsquo;ve painted a lot of fanart to the setting and made some great progress in my painting skills for last two years.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not trying to do some great return and the Blizzard is still impossible. I\u0026rsquo;m still unemployed artist who\u0026rsquo;s looking for a job and the only small profit from art gives me my patreon page and occasional commissions.\nBut I remembered that I loved Warcraft setting and enjoyed reading some lore. It\u0026rsquo;s rather another attempt with new skills to see what I can paint now. So I picked pretty famous character from the novel Rise of the Horde, orc shaman Gul\u0026rsquo;dan.\nLike my work?
