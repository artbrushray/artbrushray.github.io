      <title>Iron Butchers preparations for a battle, plus a story.</title>

      <description>We&amp;#39;ve seen plenty of art and video how space marines are served and prepared for a battle. All these are about loyal astartes. Correct me, but I&amp;#39;ve never seen an art where renegades or chaos marines are served. It may be some of them no need such procedure as they fused with their armor. But I think there are warbands and space marines which are less corrupted by chaos and still needed this service every once in a while. So we thought it would be interesting to imagine how ironclading could look like for ChSM. And today I&amp;#39;m happy to show you the result along with the small description below. </description>

      <description>Hey everybody! This work is pretty special, a bit more that a year ago form this art I started my collaboration with Iron Butchers warband: https://www.instagram.com/enter.the.butcher/ Back then I did the first version of this art: https://www.artstation.com/artwork/2qn9qg Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve painted a lot of great art for the Iron Butchers. I learned a lot and improved. Now I thought the time has come to revamp the art. I hope you like the new version of Vhorrax, Iron Warriors Warsmith.</description>

      <description>In collaboration with https://www.instagram.com/enter.the.butcher/ Iron Butchers I&amp;rsquo;ve painted a birth of the monstrous engine created by the Dark Mechanicum. Here is a brief description abouth the artwork:
Warsmith Vhorrax Immanibus, leader of the Iron Butchers, contemplates the birth of the monstrous daemon engine called &amp;ldquo;the Megatherion&amp;rdquo;.
Crafted by the combined efforts of the Dark Mechanicum and the Warband&amp;rsquo;s Warpsmiths, the Megatherion is a knight-sized monstrosity inhabited by not one, but dozens of daemons.</description>

      <description>Character for Live action role play. Wolfram is a druid sheriff, whose connection with nature is unbreakable. His bark wood metal armor was crafted by the ancient trees of the forest, and it has become a part of him. As he moves, the armor rustles like the leaves in the wind. He wields a short, thick sword with a sharp edge, forged from the bones of the earth itself. His shield, crafted from the finest wood, is round and engraved with intricate patterns.</description>

      <description>Small story which the art illustrates:
His wasn&amp;rsquo;t supposed to happen for the Blightstars to now be locked in a small-scale conflict with their former allies, the Rust Corps. All from a single, stray shell. The Blightstars, in their attempt to soften the Imperial forces, had deployed plagueburst crawlers to fire artillery upon the loyalist lines. How could they have known that the manic beast known as Ferrinox was running rampant on the front lines or that one of the many shots fired from their mortars would strike upon his position?</description>

      <description>The champion is one of the bearers of the beak&amp;rsquo;s words. He is honoured and respected by his brethren. The warband worship a greater daemon with no parts of the four dark gods. They are calling the greater daemon a god, and gain minor boons, along with mutations from it.
The leader of the warband is the head priest, Arkus Cain. Once a word-bearer, now hunted and exiled from the legion.</description>

      <description>Hi everybody!
It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I painted some Eldar, so I think this subject deserves some refreshment. Today&amp;rsquo;s character is haemonculus Yl&amp;rsquo;agran. Here&amp;rsquo;s also a piece of description for the project. Yl&amp;rsquo;agran have basically lived long enough that they are tired and suffering from writer&amp;rsquo;s block. Yl&amp;rsquo;agran is preparing a Carnival of Pain to try and reignite his passion. He has prepared a number of potent toxins and one he specifically bred some tyranid stock for.</description>

      <description>Hey everybody! This big bastard is Havok Smith Trelok Olethros the warlord of the Rust Corps Iron warrior warband. He replaced his arm with a chain cannon after losing in a fight with a Dark Angels Ravenwing captain. Most importantly he is completely and totally insane.
The Iron Warriors were the IV Legion of the twenty original Space Marine Legions. Their Primarch is Perturabo. They were one of the nine legions which betrayed the Emperor during the Horus Heresy, becoming Chaos Space Marines.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone!
I want to show you my new Warcraft fan art and to tell a small story behind it.
My love to computer games started with Starcraft. Later then when I discovered digital art, Starcraft and Warcraft were among the major sources of inspiration
Needless to say I raved about the idea of making art for the Blizzard&amp;hellip; many did. But man, how good one have to be to work with them.</description>
