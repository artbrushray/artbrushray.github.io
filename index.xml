      <description>We&amp;#39;ve seen plenty of art and video how space marines are served and prepared for a battle. All these are about loyal astartes. Correct me, but I&amp;#39;ve never seen an art where renegades or chaos marines are served. It may be some of them no need such procedure as they fused with their armor. But I think there are warbands and space marines which are less corrupted by chaos and still needed this service every once in a while. So we thought it would be interesting to imagine how ironclading could look like for ChSM. And today I&amp;#39;m happy to show you the result along with the small description below. </description>
