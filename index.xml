      <description>Hey everyone! Some more charcoal practice here. I had another busy month, mostly have been working doing print design which is infinitely more boring then drawing. Spare time I was spending on traditional media. My goal is to master charcoal. It&amp;rsquo;s intermediate material to the oil paint and it has some of oil&amp;rsquo;s features. Simple and expressive it perfectly fits for studying forms and value.
I know you might have been waiting for some digital stuff.</description>

      <description>I keep practicing with charcoal. I&amp;rsquo;m gradually trying to move from still life to anatomy starting with hands and feets. Also have a lot to do to improve the charcoal usage itself and master the material.

      <description>Character drawing practice. This time I picked two images of blacksmith and draw them with charcoal.

      <description>Hey everyone! Check out my latest Warhammer fan art featuring a Nurgle Plague Marine. Corrupted by the foul blessings of Nurgle, this warrior is a testament to the power of the Lord of Decay. His rusted armor and diseased body spread twisted corruption that runs rampant in the 41st millennium.
