      <description>Mix of my artworks November 2023.
I keep painting chaos space marines. This guy has pretty unusual and bright colour scheme. He&amp;rsquo;s a chaos champion for a warband called the Reproached Hollows, He&amp;rsquo;s only known as &amp;ldquo;The Cyclopes&amp;rdquo; Special thanks to Littlerevy and her miniature reference: https://instagram.com/littlerevy?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
Roman warrior, short personal work, a painting study
In this personal work called &amp;ldquo;Lady Victory&amp;rdquo; I was inspired by knights and medieval, fantasy vibes.</description>

      <description>Hey everyone! Today is a special artwork on Warhammer40k here. We keep expanding lore of the Iron Butchers warband: Make sure to check their instagram: https://www.instagram.com/enter.the.butcher/
If you may remember I painted a star ship for this warband, the Iron Maw, on which they crusade the Galaxy: https://www.artstation.com/artwork/g00LWe This artwork shows a pretty special part of this ship called The Daemonastrolabium. Basically it&amp;rsquo;s a huge compass which navigates the warp.</description>

      <description>Mix of my artworks October 2023.
Decided to paint some skeletons One part Sepulchral Guard, one part Son of Velmorn.
This time I was inspired by the miniature (Venomcrawler) of this monster and painted the fan art of the creature in its den in Nurgle style.
Also a few figure studies I turned into magicians.

      <description>Mix of my recent artworks.
A tomb has awakened releasing it&amp;rsquo;s dormant horrors&amp;hellip; Necrons is a special art subject for me. I did my first tries on them about 3-4 years. And what is special ever since my artistic vision of them has been changing several times. Of course the first attempts were pretty clumsy and some next art then became more mature. Nevertheless Necrons though humanoid yet distinctly different from humans at their primal form before the transfer.</description>
