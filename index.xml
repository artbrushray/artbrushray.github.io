      <description>Hey everyone! This is another revamp of one of my work. The first art of this character was painted something about a year ago for the Iron Butchers warband: https://www.instagram.com/enter.the.butcher/ Here is the link to the post with the first version of Culsu: https://www.artstation.com/artwork/6bXRxV
Then there had been some progress in my vision and work process and we decided to make another art ot the character. So this post is the result: a character with helmet and without, plus some stages.</description>

      <description>Hey everyone! Some more charcoal practice here. I had another busy month, mostly have been working doing print design which is infinitely more boring then drawing. Spare time I was spending on traditional media. My goal is to master charcoal. It&amp;rsquo;s intermediate material to the oil paint and it has some of oil&amp;rsquo;s features. Simple and expressive it perfectly fits for studying forms and value.
I know you might have been waiting for some digital stuff.</description>

      <description>I keep practicing with charcoal. I&amp;rsquo;m gradually trying to move from still life to anatomy starting with hands and feets. Also have a lot to do to improve the charcoal usage itself and master the material.
